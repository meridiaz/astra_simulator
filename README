This package gives accurate information about the landing area of a HAB (high altitude balloon)

Cases of use:
    - Predict landing point before launching de balloon: In this case original code astra_simulator will be executed. **ForecastEnvironment or SoundingEnvironment classes must be initialized**
    - Predict landing point while balloon flight: In this case motion equations are the same as in previous event, but some improvements are implemented. **RealEnvironment class must be initialized**, if not some errors may be thrown. It is highly recommended to set optional parameter numberOfSimRuns from Flight class to a high number such as 200, instead default value 10.
        - Is possible to use a terrain elevation model by setting optional parameter elevation_model from Flight class to True. Doing so, requests to a local server will be made.
        -  To test accuracy with an actual launch that occurred in the past, optional parameter forecast_wind from Flight class can be set to False. Doing that, forecast wind won't be downloaded from GPS, instead u and v coordinates from wind will be calculated using drift from latitude and longitude stored in excel file. 
        In this case, wind is assumed to be constant for all altitudes in a single simulation. Therefore some simulations will be far away from the actual landing point.
        - Despite temperature and pressure can be taken from sensors, it is necessary to use a model that provides temperature and pressure at different altitudes in a simulation. This is done by downloading a forecast from GPS. In spite of that, model variables can be corrected by comparing them with actual temperatures and pressures collected from sensors, to do so, parameter correct_data from realEnvironment class must be set to True.
